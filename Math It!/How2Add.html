                <h2>How to Add</h2>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Adding is something like 1+1, which = 2. The easiest way to get the hang of it in the beginning is thinking about it this way = You take the first number, and then add the second number in steps. For example, if we had 8+3, we would start at number 8 and then
				add in the 3. So we would count 8,9,10,11, the last number (11) being our end result, so 8+3=11</p>
				<p>Level two would be a little bit complex, as the numbers increase and getting the end result whilst counting numbers in 20s or 30s would take a long time and would be inefficient in general. In order to work with that, lets assume that we live in a world where there are only three types of banknotes-
				£1, £10 and £100 pounds note. If we where to have £125 pounds, we would have 1 £100 note, 2 £10 notes and 5 £1 notes. If we where given £424, we would add it up the following way: </br>
				We would add up £5 that we had to the £4 that we received, meaning we had £9 pounds. We would then add our 2 £10 notes to the 2 £10 notes we received, which would be 4 £10 pound notes, which is £40. Finally, we would add 1 £100 note to the 4 £100 notes, result of which would be 5 £100 notes. </br>
				 The result would be £549 - 5 £100 notes, 4 £10 notes and 9 £1 pound notes!
