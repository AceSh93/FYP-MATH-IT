                <h2>How to Subtract</h2>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Subtracting is taking away a number away from a number. So if i had 8 slices of a cake, and John took 2, that would leave me with 6 slices of a cake (8-2=6). A way to visualise it would be to take example from the addition, except we would be going down the line rather than up (start at 8, then count down with the second number (2), so it would be 8,7,6, 6 being our total number.</p>
				<p>Level two would be a little bit complex, as the numbers decrease and getting the end result whilst counting numbers down in 20s or 30s would take a long time and would be inefficient in general. In order to work with that, lets assume that we live in a world where there are only three types of banknotes-
				£1, £10 and £100 pounds note. If we where to have £424 pounds, we would have 4 £100 notes, 2 £10 notes and 4 £1 notes. If we had to give away £125, we would subtract in the following way: </br>
				We would start off with the £1notes, taking away 5 pounds away from 4, the result of which would be -1. If our result number is a negative, then we would take off 1 £10 note too, making our first equation being 14-5, sum of which is 9. We would then look at our remaining 1 £10 note and take off 2 £10 notes, using 1 £100 note to give us 11-2, which would leave us with 9 £10 notes again.
				Finally, we would take our 3 £100 notes and subtract 1 £100 from it, giving us 2 £100 notes that remain. The total number would be £299!
				 Example of the above</p>
